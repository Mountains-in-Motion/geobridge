      <p><b>06.02.2026</b></p>
      <p><b>Guest 1:</b> Dr. Emiel van Loon, from the University of Amsterdam</p>
      <p>Dr. Emiel is an Associate Professor of Statistical Ecology specializing in dynamic and machine-learning models for ecological systems. His research uses GPS tracking, weather radar, and virtual navigation experiments to study animal memory, population dynamics, and large-scale bird and rodent movement.</p>
      <p><b>Talk:</b> How to interpret map correlations?</p> 
      <p>This presentation (the first from 2 in fact) emphasizes the limitations of measures of Association. These limitations apply to any type of data (spatial as well as non-spatial), however there are a number of special issues with spatial data that are often overlooked, especially effects of clustering and spatial autocorrelation, invisibility of orientation and the inversion of relationships with scale conversions. Fortunately there are ways to remediate these problems and design meaningful measures of association - these will be demonstrated in part 2.</p>

      <p><b>Guest 2:</b> Augusto C. Lima, from the University of Bergen</p>
      <p>Augusto is an early-career researcher in global climate change at the Department of Biological Sciences, UiB. His research focuses on cryosphere monitoring in mountain ranges, from reconstructing glacier-climate dynamics in paleo time scales to apply Earth Observation and GIS techniques to access present and future glacier behaviour. His work also emphasize open science, interdisciplinary collaboration and educational outreach, such as the GeoBridge community.</p>
      <p><b>Talk:</b> GeoBridge Overview</p> 
      <p>GeoBridge is both a community and a collaborative platform for students and researchers in all career stages who are interested in the application of Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing to landscape analysis in a changing world. In this presentation, we are going through a brief history of the GeoBridge idealization and concept, our team members and collaborators, our planned events for Spring 2026, our ongoing research projects, and the next steps with GeoBridge. We are also showcasing past and ongoing GIS/RS research from the Mountain in Motions research team, in a way to disseminate UiB research and promote further collaboration between our community.</p>

      <p><b>20.02.2026</b></p>
      <p><b>Guest 1:</b> Ide Lie-Nilsen, from the University of Bergen</p>
      <p>Ida is a PhD candidate in global change ecology at the Department of Biological Science, UiB. Her PhD project will focus on patterns, drivers, and consequences of vegetation change in mountainous ecosystems. She holds a Master of Science in Ecology, with a specialization in ecological resilience. Ida is particularly interested in integrating remote sensing with field-based studies to improve the mapping and understanding of vegetation change in a changing climate. </p>
      <p><b>Talk:</b> Estimating resilience in Norwegian coastal heathland systems</p>
      <p>Climate change is driving biodiversity loss and causing shifts in disturbance regimes worldwide. Coastal heathlands, one of Norway’s most vulnerable ecosystems, hold both high cultural and ecological value, yet understanding how they will respond to future changes in climate remains poorly understood. With changing temperature, precipitation and drought patterns forecast for Norway, understanding the vegetation dynamics of coastal heathlands in response to disturbance is essential. Ecological resilience, the capacity of an ecosystem to resist and recover from disturbances, is an important concept for uncovering more about these responses. This study focuses on resilience and recovery rates within three coastal heathland areas over a latitudinal gradient and investigates how temperature and precipitation affect their stability. Using time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at 250m resolution, resilience is quantified by estimating post-disturbance recovery rates. </p>
